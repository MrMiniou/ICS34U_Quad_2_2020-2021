## Note â€“ Introduction to Python

Python is a commonly used beginner programming language since it is considerd to be more easily readable and has simpler syntax. **Syntax** refers to the rules of a programming language; similarly to how grammar refers to the rules of a human language.

Python is also a relatively powerful language. It is used to support YouTube, Google, Instagram, Reddit, and other popular software programs.

Python has consistently been in the top three most popular programming langauges over the past two decades. Other languages that have been consistantly popular include Java, C, and Javascript.


### Python Code

Here is an example of the classic "Hello World" program, in which `Hello World` is printed onto the screen. In Python, it is a quick one-line program.

### Comments

Comments are used to write words in your program to help explain what is going on to someone reading your code. There are two types of comments: single-line and multi-line. 

* **Multi-line comments** take up multiple lines of code. In Python, they start with `'''` or `"""` and end the same way.

* **Single-line comments** take up only one line of code or one partial line of code. In Python, they start with `#`. These types of comments are typically used to provide a brief decription of what's going on in a particular line of code.

The code above contains an example of a single-line comment.

### Writing Python Code Using Repl.it

In this course, we will be using [repl.it](http://repl.it) (pronounced "rep-lit") to write Python code. Repl.it is a web-based programming environment. It is not the best programming environment, however we are using it since it can be used on your Chromebooks as does not require you to download any software.
